## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to
GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and
a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` r
example_plot()
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'
    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'
